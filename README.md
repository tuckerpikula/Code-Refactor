# Code-Refactor
https://tuckerpikula.github.io/Code-Refactor/

The purpose of this project was to change the div to semantic elements such as nav or section. We were also supposed to shorten the css to make it simpler. I also added code comments to explain the changes I made and where they are on the page.
